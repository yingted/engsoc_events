== engsoc\_events ==
for EngSoc Hack Day 2013
=== setup ===
1. install django and run syncdb
2. add a panel pointing to /events
3. generate a new django secret key
=== urls ===
- all panels: /
- events (scrolling): /events
- add HTML to events: /modify
- other admin: /admin
=== issues ===
(in alphabetical order, to make up for not using the issue tracker)
- admin interface has crappy friendly names (i.e. "updated" message is "Event with this Eid already exists.")
- admin does not use syntax highlighting or show previews
- delays
- does not create a default panel
- does not display multiple panels (not an inherent limitation)
- does not publish to LED screens (not an inherent limitation, can be done in the polling loop)
- event overwrite behaviour hard-coded
- import ignores timezones
- import ignores recurrence rules
- import uses hard-coded 25-item paging
- jquery scrolling jumps to the top of the page (perhaps use CSS animations if EngSoc LCDs support it?)
- the SASS/CSS sucks (although it correctly handles mobile screens)
=== default events.db ===
user: root
email: root@example.com
password: root@example.com
